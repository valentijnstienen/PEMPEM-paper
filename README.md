If your raw data needs pre-processing (most likely), make sure you verify (adjust when necessary) the settings for the pre-processing algorithm ([Settings_PreprocessingAlgorithm.py](https://github.com/valentijnstienen/PEMPEM-paper/blob/main/Data%20(github)/SETTINGS_PreprocessingAlgorithm.py)) according to your wishes. For more details on the data pre-processing, we refer to the corresponding [Data pre-processing page](https://github.com/valentijnstienen/PEMPEM-paper/tree/main/Data%20(github)).
